I am an Assistant Professor in the Innovative Computing Group at the Department of Computer Science at Durham University. My primary research interests lie in the field of computer graphics, in particular applied visual perception to rendering and display hardware, with a strong focus on near-eye displays and virtual reality. 

Before joining Durham in 2018, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Inria, France, team GraphDeco, and visiting scholar at UC Berkeley Vision Science, USA, working on near-eye, stereo displays.
